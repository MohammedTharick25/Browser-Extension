## ðŸ§  How It Works

- **Popup UI (`index.html`)**  
  Contains an input field and three buttons:
  - `SAVE INPUT` â†’ Adds the typed URL to the list
  - `SAVE TAB` â†’ Captures the URL of the current tab
  - `DELETE ALL` â†’ Clears the list when double-clicked

- **Script (`index.js`)**  
  - Stores leads in an array
  - Saves them to `localStorage`
  - Renders links inside a `<ul>` element
  - Uses `chrome.tabs.query` to get the current tabâ€™s URL

- **Styling (`index.css`)**  
  Clean and minimal layout with green highlight color for buttons and links
